## Notes

It was a good refresher on some basic JavaScript concepts; however, there were some challenges in developing this webpage:
* The img tag did not display the images inside the div tag. It was displaying outside the div tag. I tried many different ways. Because I was all over the place, I did not pay attention to the comments. It was mentioned in the comments that I should have a space between the closing tag and the src of the image. After that, I followed the template string method to display all the game contents.
* I was familiar with the reduce() and filter () function before. I mostly like to use filter function; however, the logic I was trying to implement was easier with the reduce() function because I needed the count of the unfunded games.
* The instructions to get the key for Challenge 3 were a little confusing for me. I thought the whole syntax of the selector was part of the key. I got help from the Slack channel to figure out the key.
